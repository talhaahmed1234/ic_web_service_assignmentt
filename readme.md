# Simple Web Services

This project is a simple web service application built using Node.js and Express. It offers two services:
1. **Reverse String Service**: Reverses a given string.
2. **Square Number Service**: Squares a given number.

The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an interactive user interface for these services.

## Features

- **Reverse String Service**: Allows users to input a string, and the server will return the reversed string.
- **Square Number Service**: Allows users to input a number, and the server will return the squared value of that number.
